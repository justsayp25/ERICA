# E.R.I.C.A. (Emergency Response & Immediate Contact Alert)

E.R.I.C.A. is a privacy-first personal-safety application built with React Native and Expo. It provides discreet, one-motion emergency alerting, live location sharing, resilient offline dispatch queues, and local cryptographic privacy guarantees.

Designed as a clean-room implementation (zero GPL code incorporated; concepts informed by `dhilipmpms/SOS-alerter`), E.R.I.C.A. operates with zero analytics, zero ad SDKs, and zero third-party telemetry.

---

## Architecture Overview

E.R.I.C.A. employs a hybrid architecture balancing cross-platform testability with deep native Android integration and platform-honest iOS execution:

### 1. Shared Pure TypeScript Domain Core
- **State Machine (`sosMachine`)**: Built with XState v5, governing state transitions, cancellable countdowns, trigger aggregation, and resolution actions.
- **Offline Outbox Queue & Retry Engine**: Persistent SQLite database (`erica_outbox.db`) buffering unsent emergency alerts during dead zones or airplane mode, draining automatically with exponential backoff jitter upon network restoration.
- **Cryptographic & Privacy Layer**: Envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM), CSPRNG master key and salt generation, in-memory buffer zeroing (`Buffer.fill(0)`), and constant-time comparisons (`timingSafeEqual`).
- **100% Headless Testability**: Core logic executes and validates cleanly under Node.js (`npm test`) without requiring hardware emulators.

### 2. Android Native Kotlin Expo Modules
- **`SilentSmsModule` (`modules/silent-sms`)**: Directly interfaces with Android `SmsManager` (`sendTextMessage` and `sendMultipartTextMessage` with multi-SIM support), enabling **true silent background dispatch** without user interaction or opening a UI composer. Distributed via direct APK sideload and F-Droid to bypass Google Play `SEND_SMS` restrictions.
- **`ForegroundServiceModule` (`modules/foreground-service`)**: Elevated `EmergencyForegroundService` (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION`) with persistent lockscreen notification (`erica_emergency_channel`), `START_STICKY` lifecycle, and partial wake locks surviving task dismissal.
- **`PhysicalTriggersModule` (`modules/physical-triggers`)**: `EricaAccessibilityService` bound to Android `system_server` to intercept 4x volume down clicks while the screen is locked or turned off, awakening the UI over keyguard. `EricaBootReceiver` guarantees outbox drain across device reboots.

### 3. iOS Capability-Honest Companion
- Adheres strictly to Apple platform sandboxing, which prohibits background programmatic SMS and global hardware key interception.
- Operates as a **capability-honest companion**: provides UI-driven cancellable countdowns, fallback to native SMS composer (`expo-sms`) pre-populated with live GPS links.

## Hardware Testing & Platform Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> E.R.I.C.A.'s JavaScript/TypeScript logic is covered by automated tests that run in CI. On-device testing on reference Android hardware (Doze, locked keyguard, airplane-mode dead zones, reboot) is defined in [ADVERSARIAL_DEVICE_TESTING.md](docs/ADVERSARIAL_DEVICE_TESTING.md) but **has no recorded results yet**; until the results log there is filled in, treat background reliability on real phones as unverified.
>
> We deliberately **avoid overreaching claims such as "certified"**, as the vast landscape of Android device manufacturers, proprietary battery managers, and carrier-specific basebands prevents universal guarantees.

For detailed device configuration, ADB validation commands, and OEM battery optimizer bypass steps, consult:
- [Real-World Adversarial & Reference Hardware Test Verification](docs/ADVERSARIAL_DEVICE_TESTING.md)
- [ADR 001: Native Kotlin Architecture Pivot & Capability-Honest iOS Companion](docs/adr/001-native-kotlin-and-ios-companion.md)
- [ADR 0001: Hermes Cryptographic Primitives & PBKDF2 Latency Benchmark](docs/adr/0001-hermes-crypto-subtle-support-and-pbkdf2-latency.md)

## Trust & Privacy Guarantees

1. **Hardware-Backed Cryptography**: All offline contacts, history logs, evidence, and outbox payloads are encrypted at rest with authenticated AES-256-GCM, using a master key held in the phone's hardware keystore.
2. **SMS Baseline**: Alerts go out as plain SMS through your own SIM, so contacts need nothing installed (see [LAWS.md](LAWS.md) Law 3).
3. **Zero Telemetry**: No analytics, ads or tracking. Data only leaves the phone as an alert you send (Law 5).

The PIN app lock, biometric unlock and duress PIN were removed on 2026-10-05 at the project owner's request (see the LAWS.md Amendment Log).
